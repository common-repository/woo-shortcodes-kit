= How can i translate WSHK? =

WSHK is internazionalized, have an english template and the ready Spanish translation.

By default the plugin take your site language how reference, so dont need nothing to get the plugin if your language is English or Spanish.

If you need translate to other languages, you can do it by yourself, just need make click in the developement section and do click in [Translate "WSHK" into your language](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wshk) or use [Loco Translate](https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) to write your own language from the English template.


= Which is your recommendation ? =

This plugin has been tested with templates such as Storefront, Hello theme by Elementor, GeneratePress, The7 and Betheme. But in no case is absolute compatibility ensured.

It has also been tested with page builders such as Elementor, Divi, Gutenberg, Visual Composer + Ultimate addons for VC. But neither is absolute compatibility guaranteed.

Each project is different, not all are complemented by the same plugins, so it becomes quite complex to ensure it.

If there is something that doesn't work for you, it gives you compatibility problems or whatever, don't despair.

The plugin is free and you have support, from which I will be happy to try to offer you a solution as much as possible.
